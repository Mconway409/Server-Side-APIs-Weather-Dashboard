# Server-Side-APIs-Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This assignment was to utilize the Open Weather App api to create a dashboard that gives the user the ability to search for a city and have the current weather information returned to them. The dashboard will also give a 5 day forecast for that city.  PReviously searched cities are stored in a list, and clicking on a city from that list will once again display the weather conditions.
